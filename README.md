- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DS-SophB
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sharing tips and tricks for coding in Python, SQL, R, SAS and bash as well as any cool features, courses, cheat sheets or articles I have come accross during my journey as a Data Scientist so far
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in Python, SQL and use Google Cloud Platforms for Data science applications in the energy domain. This is also my first GitHub page so I am learning how to do that too! I hope I can give you something useful to put in your toolbox to take on your own journey
